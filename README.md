## Explanation: 
This app helps you to be consistent towards your goal of any habit building (Exercise) by staking own money and might win some.

- Step 1: You enrol to the contest and stake a money and you will keep a promise that you're going to be consistent for the next two months.
- Step 2: Like you, 199 other people joined the contest as well and they also stake their money. 
- Step 3: Everyone stakes $100, and total pool become $20,000. 
- Step 4: You have to check in to the gym everyday to maintain the streak. By doing that you're proving that you're consistent. 
- Step 5: If you lose one day streak, you're out. And your money will stay at the pool.
- Step 6: At the end of the 2 month, if 20 people will able to complete the streak successfully, the whole pool of $20,000 will be distributed among 20 people. and everyone will receive $1000. Isn't that great!! ðŸš€
